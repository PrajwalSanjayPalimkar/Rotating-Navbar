            <p>Study environment refers to the physical, psychological and social circumstances that affect your wellbeing as a student and how you experience your studies. The term study environment is often used, but the law often refers to students' work
                environment. <br> The important part is to choose an area with minimal interruptions â€“ a quiet, relaxing space where you can focus and get work done. By dedicating a particular area to your schoolwork, you can train your brain to focus
                exclusively on studying, and not your list of to-dos or other distractions.</p>
